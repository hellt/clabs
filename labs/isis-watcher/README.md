# IS-IS watcher. Tracking IS-IS topology changes in Real-Time

![IS-IS watcher containerlab](https://gitlab.com/rdodin/pics/-/wikis/uploads/d164f3d0688a85ed89206c25d7be4bb4/CleanShot_2025-03-22_at_13.11.19_2x.png)   
This lab consists of 6 FRR routers and a single IS-IS Watcher. Each router is pre-configured to be part of an IS-IS domain with different network types. Any topology changes detected by the IS-IS Watcher are logged in the file `watcher/watcher.log`. The logging capabilities can be enhanced with tools like ELK or Topolograph, enabling features such as searching changes by time and exporting data to message brokers, Zabbix, and more. For further details, refer to the Links page.

### IS-IS Topology Watcher
IS-IS Watcher is a monitoring tool of IS-IS topology changes for network engineers. It works via passively listening to IS-IS control plane messages through a specially established IS-IS adjacency between IS-IS Watcher and one of the network device. *It assists in analyzing incidents by determining the precise time and location of events, as well as their distribution across the network in a retrospective manner.*  

#### Detected network events:
* IS-IS neighbor adjacency Up/Down
* IS-IS link cost changes
* IS-IS networks appearance/disappearance from the topology
* IS-IS TE attributes:
  * Administrative Group (color, resource class)
  * Maximum Link Bandwidth
  * Maximum Reservable Link Bandwidth
  * Unreserved Bandwidth
  * Traffic Engineering Default Metric

## Quickstart

1. [Install](https://containerlab.srlinux.dev/install/) containerlab.
2. Run the script to prepare environment:

    ```
    ./prepare.sh
    ```

3. Start the lab
    ```
    sudo clab deploy --topo frr01.clab.yml
    ```

4. Check that Watcher is ready (usually it requires 10-15sec to be ready). Proceed to the next step once Watcher is ready.  
    ```
    $ sudo docker logs clab-frr01-isis-watcher
    ```
    Expected output:
    ```

    Protocols Supp
    ISIS LSDB has been received
    Sniffing packets on interface: eth1
    ```

5. Start watching logs
    ```
    sudo tail -f watcher/watcher.log
    ```

6. Change IS-IS settings on lab' routers. Connect to a router in another terminal
    ```
    sudo docker exec -it clab-frr01-router6 vtysh
    ```
    Change metric on the interface
    ```
    router6# conf t
    router6(config)# int eth1
    router6(config-if)# isis metric 66
    ```

    Add new stub network
    ```
    router6(config-if)# ip address 10.10.36.6/24
    ```

    Remove another one
    ```
    router6(config-if)# no ip address 3ffe::192:168:36:6/127
    ```

    Change unreserve bandwidth TE attribute on a link
    ```
    router6(config-if)# link-params
    router6(config-link-params)# unrsv-bw 1 9+06
    ```
    assign `admin group` on a link
    ```
    router6(config-link-params)# admin-grp 0xaa
    ``` 

    Shutdown adjancency
    ```
    router6(config-if)# shutdown
    ```

### IS-IS Watcher logs location
Available under `watcher` folder. To see them:
```
sudo tail -f watcher/watcher.log
```
